/**
 * WhatsApp OTP message builder.
 *
 * WaSenderAPI drives an ordinary WhatsApp session rather than the official
 * Business API, and sending identical text on every request is an obvious bot
 * fingerprint. So a message is assembled from interchangeable parts — a
 * structural layout plus randomly chosen header, greeting, lead-in, code line,
 * validity phrasing, warning and footer. A handful of fixed templates would
 * give a handful of shapes; mixing the parts gives millions.
 *
 * Sized for ~50,000 sends: every slot below multiplies the space, so no single
 * shape should repeat more than a couple of times across the whole user base.
 *
 * Every generated message, whatever the combination, always contains:
 *   - the brand name
 *   - the code, in *bold*, on its own visual line
 *   - how long the code lasts
 *   - a warning not to share it
 *
 * Formatting uses WhatsApp markup: *bold*, _italic_.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used: zero-width characters, homoglyphs (Cyrillic
 * lookalikes) or other invisible-noise tricks. They break screen readers and
 * copy-paste of the code, and are themselves a spam signal.
